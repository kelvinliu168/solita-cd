Before continuing with this tutorial, you need to have the following software installed:

- Git_
- Vagrant_

We'll be using Git via its command-line interface, but don't worry if you don't have experience with it â€“ the instructions should be clear enough. (If they are not, please `create an issue <https://github.com/solita/solita-cd/issues/new>`_!)
